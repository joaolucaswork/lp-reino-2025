# AUGMENT IGNORE FILE - READ-ONLY PROTECTION
# ============================================================================
# This file marks directories and files that should NEVER be modified by
# Augment Agent or any AI coding assistant.
#
# CRITICAL: The webflow-source-files/ directory contains the source of truth
# for the entire project structure and styling. These files must remain
# read-only at all times.
# ============================================================================

# ====================
# READ-ONLY SOURCE FILES
# ====================
# These files are the authoritative source for HTML structure and CSS styling
# They serve as reference only and must NEVER be edited, modified, or overwritten

webflow-source-files/
webflow-source-files/**
webflow-source-files/index.html
webflow-source-files/style.css

# ====================
# ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS
# ====================
# Standard files that should not be modified without explicit permission

# Dependencies
node_modules/
node_modules/**

# Build outputs
dist/
dist/**

# Lock files (should only be modified by package managers)

# ====================
# NOTES
# ====================
# - The webflow-source-files/ directory is the PRIMARY protection target
# - These files contain the complete HTML structure and CSS styling
# - Any implementation should reference these files but never modify them
# - If changes are needed to the source files, they must be done manually
#   outside of the AI coding environment
